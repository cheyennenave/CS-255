System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was the client in this project. They wanted a product that would help raise first-time drivers' pass-rates of the Drivers' Education Test and provide students with optional test-driving, module tests, and note review from instructors. Also, they wanted to be able to display updated laws and rules from the DMV. This program had to work on multiple operating systems and be accessible with wifi and cellular data.
******************************************************
What did you do particularly well?
I created a Business Requirements Document that thoroughly supported all of the needs and expectations from the client as well as what would be needed to support the product. This includes a System Background, a breakdown of Objectives and Goals, an overview of Nonfunctional and Functional Requirements, Assumptions, Limitations, and a Gantt Chart to schedule the development process.
******************************************************
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would work on my Systems Design Document and be more thorough about the technical requirements needed for the product. In retrospect, I feel that I could have been more descriptive.
******************************************************
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I read through the provided interview with DriverPass and took notes of what stood out to me. Once I had a generic list, I created user stories to further break it down. Each one included a title, a statement about what the user story should do, and a list of attributes the user story must have to work. Once I created them and decided which was most important, I began development. It's incredibly important to consider the user's needs when designing because ultimately, you're providing a product for them. Developers have to avoid the "unending spiral" of work that can occur if too many decisions are made and an "illusion of progress" occurs. 
******************************************************
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
As stated above, I create user stories when designing software. I really enjoy using Agile Methods to help me develop, as it keeps me well-paced and on track with my programs. I will continue to use Agile in the Software Development Lifecycle to stay flexible and on-task to design a system, as it allows for timely delivery and thorough understanding of what needs to be developed.
